# Coding-Quiz

## About
This is a mostly working quiz scenario, with a functioning timer. The timer decreases 10 seconds every instance that the answer is incorrect. The final score for the user is equal to the amount of time left at the end of the quiz.

The game is also over if the timer runs out.

A user will be shown their score on the final page after the last question, where they may also type their initials.

A template High Scores page is also created, but must still be linked to the user's input and local storage.
